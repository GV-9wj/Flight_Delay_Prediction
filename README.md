# Flight_Delay_Prediction
Flight scheduling is considered one of the recent challenges faced by the industry. This Project is part of a 2 stage predictive machine learning model, that predicts whcih flight will be delayed and which flight will not, and if the flight is classified as delayed then  find the ammount by which the flight is delayed.

### Classification models and algorithms used:
1. Logistic regression 
2. Random Forest
3. Extra trees
4. XGBoost
5. Decision Trees

## Notebooks 

[1. Data-Preprocessing, processing the flight data](https://github.com/GV-9wj/Flight_Delay_Prediction/blob/master/Datapreprocessing1_Flight_Data.ipynb)

[2. Data-Preprocessing, processing the weather data](https://github.com/GV-9wj/Flight_Delay_Prediction/blob/master/Datapreprocessing2_Weather_Data.ipynb)

[3. Data-Preprocessing, merging the flight data and weather data](https://github.com/GV-9wj/Flight_Delay_Prediction/blob/master/Datapreprocessing3_Merging_Data.ipynb)
